Two pointers = explore from both sides OR adjust a window.
Greedy = always take the best local move to reach global optimum.
Combine = Move pointers in a way that shrinks or expands optimally.

Opposite Ends (Shrink to Optimum)
If current value too large → move right pointer (j--).
If too small → move left pointer (i++).

Mantra Lines (write in notes)
"If too big → shrink right, if too small → grow left."
"Expand window with right, shrink with left, track best."
"Greedy pointer moves where the limitation lies."
"Partition by condition → swap & move pointers."
