**What is Two Pointers  method?**
Instead of scanning an array multiple times or using nested loops (O(nÂ²)),
we use two indices (pointers) that move towards each other (or in the same direction) to solve the problem in O(n).

Remember !!
ðŸ‘‰ If the problem asks about PAIRS, BALANCING, or CHECKING from both sides â†’ Opposite Direction.
ðŸ‘‰ If the problem asks about SUBARRAYS, WINDOWS, or DYNAMIC RANGES â†’ Same Direction (Sliding Window).

1. Opposite Direction (start â†” end)
Setup:
  left = 0, right = n-1, move inward

When to use:
âœ… Array is sorted (or you can sort it)
âœ… Youâ€™re dealing with pairs or comparisons across ends
âœ… Problems like: sum of two numbers, checking palindrome, max/min area, etc.

Common Patterns:
  Two Sum (in sorted array)
  Valid Palindrome
  Container With Most Water (maximize area)
  Trapping Rain Water (two pointers inward)
  Squares of a Sorted Array

2. Same Direction (sliding window style)
Setup:
  left = 0, right = 0, both move forward, adjusting window

When to use:
  âœ… Need to find a subarray/substring that meets a condition
  âœ… Optimizing for longest/shortest subarray
  âœ… Tracking counts/frequencies in a window

Common Patterns:
  Longest Substring Without Repeating Chars
  Minimum Size Subarray Sum
  Find All Anagrams in a String
  Maximum Average Subarray
  Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
